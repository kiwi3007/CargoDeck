Inspired by the workflow of Radarr and Sonarr, Playerr is designed to be the definitive solution for video game enthusiasts who self-host their libraries. It bridges the gap between your local digital assets and the vast world of gaming metadata.

## Main Features

*   **Intelligent Library Scanning:** Recursive and smart recognition engine that identifies video game platforms across your storage, mapping local files to their respective titles.
*   **Rich Metadata Integration:** Native hooks into IGDB and Steam APIs to fetch high-quality artwork, descriptions, ratings, and release dates.
*   **Seamless PVR Workflow:** Support for Prowlarr and Jackett for automated indexer management and advanced searching.
*   **NZB Protocol Support:** Native integration for Usenet downloads via NZB files, automatically handling protocol associations. Compatible with **SABnzbd** and **NZBGet**.
*   **Download Client Connectivity:** Native API integration for managing transfers via industry-standard clients (qBittorrent, Transmission, SABnzbd).
*   **Modern Web GUI:** A vibrant, dark-themed responsive interface designed for both desktop and containerized environments.
*   **Smart Path & File Management:** Automatic folder renaming based on sanitized IGDB titles, preserving original release structure while keeping the library clean and organized.
*   **Automated Deployment Tool:** Efficiently processes local installation packages and identifies primary executables to streamline library organization.
*   **Unified Library View:** Display your entire gaming collection in one place, including native support for syncing and viewing your **Steam Library**.

### Compatibility & Runners
Playerr manages your library, but to execute Windows-native titles on macOS or Linux, we recommend the following compatibility layers:

* **macOS:** [Whisky](https://getwhisky.app/) (Free/Open Source) or [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover) (Paid/Official Support).
* **Linux / Steam Deck:** Native support via **Proton** (Steam), [Lutris](https://lutris.net/), or [Bottles](https://usebottles.com/).

## Installation & Setup

> **Note:** Requires valid IGDB API keys (free) for metadata fetching.

### Docker (Recommended)
The easiest way to run Playerr is using Docker. It includes everything you need in a single container. Access the UI at `http://your-ip:2727`.

#### Standard Desktop / Server
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file and run `docker-compose up -d`:
```yaml
services:
  playerr:
    image: maikboarder/playerr:latest
    container_name: playerr
    ports:
      - "2727:2727"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - /your/games/path:/media
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### CasaOS
1. Go to **App Store** -> **Custom Install**.
2. Click on **Import** (top right) and paste this specific code (includes the icon):
   ```yaml
   services:
     playerr:
       image: maikboarder/playerr:latest
       container_name: playerr
       ports:
         - "2727:2727"
       volumes:
         - /DATA/AppData/playerr/config:/app/config
         - /DATA/Media/Games:/media
       restart: unless-stopped
   
   x-casaos:
     architectures:
       - amd64
       - arm64
     main: playerr
     icon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maikboarder/Playerr/master/frontend/src/assets/app_logo.png
     title:
       en_us: Playerr
   ```
3. Click **Install**.

#### Synology / NAS
1. Open **Container Manager** (or Docker).
2. Go to **Project** -> **Create**.
3. Paste the Docker Compose code and configure your local folders.
4. Click **Done**.

### Build from Source (For Developers)

If you want to modify the code or build the image locally instead of pulling it from Docker Hub:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maikboarder/playerr.git
   cd playerr
   ```

2. Use the build command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t playerr:local .
   ```

3. Or use a `docker-compose.override.yml` to force a local build:
   ```yaml
   services:
     playerr:
       build: .
       image: playerr:local
       # ... rest of your config
   ```
